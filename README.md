# optimizing-supply-chain
1.📝 Project Overview

This project aims to enhance supply chain logistics through data analytics, forecasting, and route optimization. We use a real-world-like dataset containing product, inventory, shipping, supplier, and cost information. The core goals are to:
Analyze sales and logistics patterns
Forecast future product demand
Optimize delivery routes
Recommend strategies to reduce costs and improve efficiency


2.🧪 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Plotly, Seaborn – Interactive data visualizations

Prophet – Time series forecasting

OR-Tools (Google) – Route optimization

Scikit-learn – Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE)


3.🔄 Pipeline

Data Collection – Structured dataset with 100 records on supply chain operations

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, type casting, and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – KPIs, trends, pie/bar/line charts

Forecasting – Product demand forecasting using Facebook Prophet

Route Optimization – Minimizing transportation cost using OR-Tools (Dijkstra/Genetic Algorithm/VRP)

KPI Dashboard – Track metrics like lead time, manufacturing cost, shipping cost, and defect rate

4.📊 Key Visualizations
